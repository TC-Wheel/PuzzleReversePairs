# PuzzleReversePairs
Reverse pairs are words that are valid backwards and forwards.
For example: Stressed and desserts are reverse pairs
Stressed dessertS
sTressed desserTs
stRessed desseRts
strEssed dessErts
streSsed desSerts
stresSed deSserts
stressEd dEsserts
stresseD Desserts

I write code to solve a puzzle that finds all known reverse pairs in the English language.
