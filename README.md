# PuzzleReversePairs
Reverse pairs are words that are valid backwards and forwards.
For example: Stressed and desserts are reverse pairs
<br /> Stressed dessertS
<br /> sTressed desserTs
<br /> stRessed desseRts
<br /> strEssed dessErts
<br /> streSsed desSerts
<br /> stresSed deSserts
<br /> stressEd dEsserts
<br /> stresseD Desserts

<br />I write code to solve a puzzle that finds all known reverse pairs in the English language.
